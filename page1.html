        My name is Enkhjin Erdenebat, I go by Enk. I am a 21 year old woman
        living in New York City. <br />
        I moved here when I was 18 to study at Parsons School of Design for an
        undergraduate degree in <br />
        Design and Technology. My hometown is Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, which is
        where I was born and raised. <br />
        I am a Buddhist.

        I am unemployed currently, and have never worked a job in my life
        before. I have done <br />
        internships and “experience accumulating” jobs. My dad is a financial
        consultant at an Italian <br />cashmere firm. My mom works both in
        political and non governmental organizations. I have one older
        <br />sibling who is 8 years older than me. My mom used to live in the
        U.K and my dad <br />
        grew up in Soviet Mongolia. Neither of my parents are capable of wearing
        jewelry for some reason, <br />
        and I was never allowed to dye my hair, have long nails, or have any
        piercings. My mom’s favorite color <br />
        is beige and my dad’s is white. I graduated from a private school, and I
        wanted to become a lawyer, ballerina dancer, <br />
        or a dermatologist at some point. I am currently interested in hippie
        fashion, indie sleaze, <br />
        all leisurely activities, cooking and cigarettes. My favorite artist
        right now is John Glacier, <br />
        but Drake and Future I will always listen to. <br /><br />
        My fashion inspirations as of today are: Kim Bekker, Hedi Slimane, Jane
        Birkin, Charlotte Gainsbourg,<br />
        Caroline Besette Kennedy, my mom, and my sister when she was cool.
