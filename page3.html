        I think being an international student, I remember the first year my
        other asian <br />
        friends were really insecure about being “fresh off the boat”, and they
        tried to <br />
        dress like everybody else. But looking back, I think that was just a
        part of getting <br />
        used to a new place, no matter how much we tried, when I look back at
        the way I dressed, <br />
        I did in fact look FOB. In Susan Kaisner’s “Intersectional,
        Transnational Fashion <br />
        Subjects”, they discuss ambiguity and use an example of an artist who
        “conveyed the <br />
        in-betweenness of his subject positions”. I related to this deeply, as
        someone who grew up in <br />
        multiple cultures, I would often polarize between my subjects, <br />
        depending on where and who I was with. <br />
