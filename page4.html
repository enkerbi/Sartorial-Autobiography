        When I first moved to NYC, I shopped at Zara. I liked Alexa Chung,
        Arctic Monkeys, <br />
        The Weeknd, Drake and smoking weed. The reality was I did not even have
        Zara in my hometown. <br />
        Weed was illegal, Mcdonaldâ€™s refused to open because of a stupid
        lawsuit, and I had a 10pm curfew. <br />
        My mom and dad shaped an identity for me growing up and so did my
        sister.
        <br />
        <br />
        I indulged in a lot of crap when I first moved here because I had
        nothing back home.<br />
        When I look back, I feel sorry for myself and everyone else who grew up
        in a third world country, <br />
        because I could have been here 5 years ago. I feel like I learned a lot
        of things really late<br />
        and I feel sort of embarrased, ashamed and guilty.

        It is really hard to describe the way I feel, <br /> because it is a mixture of 
        emotions. I guess I just felt behind.
