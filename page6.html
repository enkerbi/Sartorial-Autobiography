        I think my overall dress practice from the dress logs I have done, is
        that I <br />
        like to be comfortable. I heard my friend say this often, does the
        outfit wear<br />
        you or do you wear the outfit? And I feel like I apply this to my dress
        practice. <br />
        Because I am a student, and I have no other occupation, my main concern
        is being <br />
        comfortable. <br />

        I sometimes feel like when I dress up I have to be in a certain mindset
        to do it, <br />
        like my parents are unable to wear any jewelry, dressing up to me feels
        kind of <br />
        annoying in that sense, that there is too much on me. However, when I am
        in that <br />
        mindset to dress up, I find myself feeling very confident in my outfit,
        but if I were <br />
        to wear the same outfit on a day I didnâ€™t feel like it, I would feel
        really detached <br />
        and uncomfortable, because then it feels like the outfit is wearing me.
