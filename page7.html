      <p>
        Another thing I noticed throughout my dress log is that I don’t really
        like wearing <br />
        feminine clothing, and I usually fall back on androgynous items of
        <br />
        clothing. I love wearing pants, boots and a t- shirt. Sometimes if I
        <br />
        want to feel sexy I will wear a top that is more tighter, or the <br />
        material is more sheer. Then I thought about signifiers, like what kind
        <br />
        of person am I presenting myself to be everyday, and I think I don’t
        <br />
        really like to stand out. I don’t know how to explain this, but the way
        <br />
        I would describe it is I see myself like an
        <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/">"Apple Macbook”</a>. It is
        sleek,
        <br />
        understated, and quiet. I don’t know if it is boring or plain, because
        <br />
        to me it doesn’t feel that way, but I don’t think I am trying to emulate
        <br />
        quiet luxury, I think my personality and my mood on a day to day basis
        <br />
        is quite tranquil and lowkey. <br />
