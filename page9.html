        My boyfriend said; “You dress androgynous, but it depends on your mood…
        <br />
        …. Your outfit usually reflects on how you feel that day but at the
        same<br />
        time you dress to impress because you don’t know who you’ll see. From<br />
        the time you wake up to eating breakfast it’s gonna impact what you
        put<br />
        on that day. It may even come down to the weather. I like your style<br />
        because in a world of fake purists & overly sensitive people you're
        not<br />
        that. You leave things to art and the consumer perception and I like<br />
        that. The pieces you buy might not know the meaning to it but as long
        as<br />
        you feel good in it that’s all that matters. You have swag you
        mismatch<br />
        what you want, it's beautiful. You don’t fall into trends that a lot
        of<br />
        people in society nowadays fall into and base their whole personality<br />
        off a style they found on tumblr or instagram, you’re yourself and I<br />
        love that.”<br />
